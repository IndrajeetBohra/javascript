# JavaScript Learning Repository

This repository contains my JavaScript learning progress while following the
**JavaScript Full Course** by SuperSimpleDev.

It includes multiple small examples and practice files covering JavaScript fundamentals,
DOM manipulation, and basic projects.

## Status

This repository is a **work in progress** and is updated regularly as I progress
through the course.

## Disclaimer

This repository is created for learning purposes only and follows an online tutorial.
The structure and examples are inspired by the course content.

Just following the tutorial no changes.

### maybe make a seprate repo for making changes to the website
